Johnson Ding's Java and Git playground


I am adding this sentence to see if github can update my file ;)
Purely for fun


Can I actually see the changes that I have made to files before?

I have already cloned my playground to a local folder on my laptop and now I am editing this README on VSCode. I am now trying to commit changes to this file by using the terminal in VSCode instead of using the github website.
